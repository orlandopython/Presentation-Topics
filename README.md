# Presentation-Topics
A list of previous and proposed presentation topics at OPUG meetups.

## Proposed

We are always looking for presentation topics. If you feel confident enough that you could talk about it for five minutes, chances are that it would make a good presentation. Here is the general list of presentation topic ideas compiled from previous meetups:

>Data Wrangling/Cleaning (Pandas, PandaSQL, iPython)
>Data Analytics, Visualization (D3, Beaker)
>DBs, Storage, ORMs (AWS, Azure, Cassandra, Mongo, Parse, SQLAlchemy)
>Frameworks (Kivy, Flask, Django)
>Microservices, ESBs, Sandboxes (Docker, Zato.io, Runnable.io)
>Other (Python + Electron, Machine Learning)

When listing, give a brief description along with your name and Slack name (if you have one).
