# Presentation-Topics
A list of previous and proposed presentation topics at OPUG meetups.

## Proposed

We are always looking for presentation topics. If you feel confident enough that you could talk about it for five minutes, chances are that it would make a good presentation. Here is the general list of presentation topic ideas compiled from previous meetups:

* Data Wrangling/Cleaning (Pandas, PandaSQL, iPython)
* Data Analytics, Visualization (D3, Beaker)
* DBs, Storage, ORMs (AWS, Azure, Cassandra, Mongo, SQLAlchemy)
* Frameworks (Kivy, Flask, Django)
* Microservices, ESBs, Sandboxes (Docker, Zato.io, Runnable.io)
* Other (Python + Electron, Machine Learning)

When listing, give a brief description along with your name and Slack name (if you have one).
